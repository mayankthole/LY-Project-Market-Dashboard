Title of the Project:
C2 Algorithmic Trading Engine — Zerodha Dashboard MVP

Objectives: List of objectives with details
1) Build a simple, reliable stock market dashboard (Streamlit) integrated with Zerodha (KiteConnect).
   - Read credentials from .env only; avoid Google Sheets and external dependencies.
   - Keep the app running continuously with auto-refresh and graceful error handling.
2) Provide core portfolio visibility and market insights.
   - Holdings, positions, orders, margins, profile in one place.
   - Live LTP for an expanded watchlist with sector filtering.
   - Correct price change based on previous close; top gainers/losers view.
3) Add basic analytics for decision support.
   - Technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD) and historical candles.
   - Sector exposure, correlation matrix, quick performance simulation.
4) Deliver a clean, maintainable UX.
   - Standard tabs only, simplified sidebar, log suppression for clean terminal.
   - No custom JS navigation; minimal session state.

Requirement analysis: requirement analysis document
- Functional Requirements
  • Load Zerodha credentials from .env and establish authenticated session.
  • Fetch and display holdings, positions, orders, margins, and profile.
  • Show live prices (LTP), top gainers/losers, sector-filtered watchlist.
  • Display analytics (SMA/RSI/MACD), sector analysis, correlation, and simple simulations.
  • Auto-refresh data at a configurable interval without blocking UI.

- Non-Functional Requirements
  • Reliability: Must continue running without manual intervention; recover from transient API errors.
  • Performance: Snappy UI; avoid heavy blocking calls; no infinite loops.
  • Usability: Clean tabs, minimal clutter; actionable summaries.
  • Security: Do not log secrets; credentials only via .env.
  • Maintainability: Single-file MVP with clear sections and comments where needed.

- Constraints
  • Market data and actions limited by Zerodha API rate limits and permissions.
  • IST market timing windows determine availability of some live metrics.
  • No trading (execution) in MVP; analytics/read-only focus.

- Assumptions
  • Valid Zerodha access token present in .env during evaluation.
  • Internet connectivity is stable for API calls.

Dataset : details of the dataset required for the application along with its sources
- Live Market Data (Quotes/LTP)
  • Source: Zerodha KiteConnect (quote/ltp endpoints)
  • Use: Live watchlist, gainers/losers, sector views

- Portfolio & Orders
  • Source: Zerodha API (holdings, positions, orders, margins, profile)
  • Use: Portfolio overview, P&L summaries, order volume (today-only)

- Historical OHLCV
  • Source: Zerodha historical API (where available) or local `instruments.csv` for mappings
  • Use: Candlestick charts, SMA/RSI/MACD calculations

- Instruments Metadata
  • Source: `instruments.csv` (bundled) and/or Zerodha master dump
  • Use: Symbol-display mapping, sector grouping (static mapping where needed)

Methodology /  Algorithm: Methodology suggested for the application with proper justification
- System Architecture (MVP)
  • UI Layer: Streamlit app (`simple_dashboard.py`) structured into 8 tabs
  • Data Access Layer: KiteConnect client, helper functions for portfolio and quotes
  • Config: `.env` via `python-dotenv`
  • Visualization: Plotly (PX/GO) for charts and analytics

- Data Flow
  1) Load secrets from `.env` and initialize KiteConnect with access token
  2) Fetch portfolio (holdings, positions, orders, margins, profile)
  3) Fetch quotes/LTP for watchlist and compute changes from previous close
  4) Optionally fetch historical OHLC for selected symbols to compute indicators
  5) Render tab-wise views; schedule periodic `st.rerun()` for auto-refresh

- Algorithms / Computations
  • Technical Indicators: SMA, RSI, MACD computed from OHLC time series
  • Price Change: `((LTP - PrevClose) / PrevClose) * 100`, ensures correctness
  • Order Volume Today: Group orders by hour for current trading day; bar chart
  • Risk/Analytics: Sector allocation, correlation matrix, simple return simulation

- Reliability Practices
  • Removed infinite loops; use `st.rerun()` after `sleep` for refresh
  • Defensive `try/except` with user-friendly messages; removed noisy logs
  • Avoided caching unhashable objects (no `@st.cache_data` on Kite client)

- Justification
  • Streamlit enables rapid delivery and reliable, persistent dashboards
  • Zerodha API provides sufficient data for read-only insights in MVP
  • Simple architecture reduces operational overhead and failure points
