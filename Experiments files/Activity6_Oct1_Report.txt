Title of the Project:
C2 Algorithmic Trading Engine — Zerodha Dashboard MVP


Implementation of Functional Component/Module

What was implemented/refined by October 1
- Navigation Simplification
  • Removed custom header/sidebar navigation; rely on standard Streamlit tabs for reliability
  • Eliminated session-state/JS tab-switch hacks

- Sidebar Cleanup
  • Removed Quick Stats and Account Info from sidebar to avoid scope issues for `kite`
  • Kept essential controls only: auto-refresh, last updated time, market status/timings, tips

- Live Prices & Market Data
  • Dedicated tabs for Live Prices and Market Data with expanded watchlist and sector filtering
  • Price change corrected to use previous close; clear gainers/losers sections

- Orders Visualization
  • Today-only order volume bar chart grouped by hour to simplify intraday view

- Stability & Logging
  • Replaced infinite loops with `st.rerun()`-based refresh
  • Removed caching on unhashable Kite client; handled pandas dtype edge cases
  • Added `.streamlit/config.toml` and in-app logging suppression (error level) to keep terminal clean

- UI Polish
  • Clean page header, consistent metrics, and organized tab layout
  • Small copy tweaks and removal of redundant messages


Current Working Modules (as of Oct 1)
1) Zerodha Integration & Config (.env based)
2) Portfolio/Orders/Margins/Profile fetchers with derived metrics
3) Live Market Data (LTP, change%, gainers/losers, sector filter)
4) Analytics (SMA/RSI/MACD, correlation, sector exposure)
5) Market Analysis (historical candles with overlays)
6) UI/Refresh/Error handling and logging controls


Notes on Testing/Results
- Dashboard runs continuously without blocking; refresh interval configurable
- Terminal is quiet (warnings suppressed); user-facing errors shown inline when needed
- Navigation is robust using built-in tabs; no misclick/JS timing issues
- Live prices and watchlist scale well; sector filter improves discoverability
- Order volume chart communicates intraday activity succinctly
