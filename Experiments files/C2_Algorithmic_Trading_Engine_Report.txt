Title of the Project: C2 Algorithmic Trading Engine (Zerodha Dashboard MVP)


Executive Summary
We built a simple, persistent stock market dashboard (MVP) using Streamlit and Zerodha API. The app reads credentials from a .env file, fetches portfolio and market data, and presents actionable insights across eight tabs. The design prioritizes reliability, speed, and clarity over complexity.


Problem Statement (focused)
Manual trading is slow, emotional, and limited in coverage. Traders need a reliable way to view portfolio status, live prices, and market insights in one place without complex setups.

Scope (aligned to MVP)
- Broker: Zerodha (KiteConnect)
- Exchanges: NSE/BSE equities (read-only analytics; no auto-trading in MVP)
- Delivery: Streamlit dashboard that runs continuously and auto-refreshes
- Config: .env-based credentials (no Google Sheets)


What We Delivered
- Streamlit dashboard with 8 tabs: Holdings, Positions, Orders, Account, Analytics, Market Analysis, Live Prices, Market Data
- Zerodha integration using .env: ZERODHA_API_KEY, ZERODHA_API_SECRET, ZERODHA_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Portfolio: holdings, positions, orders, margins, profile
- Live Prices: expanded watchlist (>80 tickers) with sector filter, top gainers/losers
- Correct change calculation from previous close
- Order Volume (today-only) hourly bar chart
- Analytics: SMA, RSI, MACD; sector exposure; correlation matrix; performance simulation
- Market Analysis: historical candles + indicators
- Auto-refresh via st.rerun; removed infinite loops; robust error handling
- Clean UI: standard tabs, simplified sidebar; removed custom navigation
- Log suppression for clean terminal output


Architecture & Tech Stack
- Python, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly (PX/GO)
- kiteconnect (Zerodha), python-dotenv, pytz
- Single-file app: simple_dashboard.py; credentials via .env


Setup (for evaluators)
1) Create .env with:
   ZERODHA_API_KEY=...
   ZERODHA_API_SECRET=...
   ZERODHA_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
2) Install deps: pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Run: streamlit run simple_dashboard.py


Work Completed as of July 15
- Literature review and problem definition
- Decided MVP scope and tech stack
- Basic Streamlit scaffold and .env-based config

Progress After July 15 (Current)
- Integrated Zerodha API; portfolio + live market data
- Added tabs, indicators, sector analysis, and clean UI
- Implemented auto-refresh and error/log handling


Timeline (condensed and aligned)
- July (2nd half): Research, scope, .env setup, Streamlit scaffold — COMPLETED
- August (1st half): Architecture, Zerodha account/setup — COMPLETED
- August (2nd half): Dashboard skeleton, data structures — COMPLETED
- September (1st half): Zerodha data integration, indicators, portfolio views — COMPLETED
- September (2nd half): Analytics pages, order chart (today-only) — COMPLETED
- October (1st half): UI polish, live prices expansion, stability & logging — COMPLETED
- October (2nd half): Optional future: backtesting, execution wiring — PLANNED
- November (1st half): Testing, docs, presentation — PLANNED


Future Work (beyond MVP)
- Backtesting framework and strategy evaluation
- Broker-agnostic layer (Dhan/Angel One)
- Execution engine with safety checks (paper/live)
- Alerting, notifications, and basic automations


Conclusion
We delivered a focused Zerodha dashboard MVP that is simple to run, continuously updates, and provides practical insights. It avoids unnecessary complexity (no Sheets, no JS navigation) and uses a clean, extensible codebase suited for the next phases (backtesting and execution).
